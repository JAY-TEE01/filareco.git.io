    <p>What the general public rarely understands is how numerous and often scam cases occur. Fraud doesn’t just happen to gullible old people in retirement homes, it can happen to anyone including you. The reason behind this is that scammers constantly work on new ways to extort people’s money and personal information. </p>
    <p>Fraudsters are constantly on the lookout for a new target and they prey on people’s desires, decency, and even desperation. The scammers work in groups to make complex strategies and practice social engineering, so eventually, anyone can become their victim. To make things worse these deceitful organizations constantly find new ways to trap people. </p>
    <p>Wherever there is an opportunity for making money, scammers will try to infiltrate. As long as there are people who want something, like love, security, and a desire for better life con artists will try to exploit that. This is the reason why scams are so pervasive and always take a new form. Since they are so numerous we have selected a list of common ones and we would like to present it to you.</p>
<div class="imglister">
    <ol>
        <img src="images/FORSAGE-BUSD-REVIEW.png" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            
            <h2>Forsage</h2>
            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused the pyramid scam Forsage of defrauding retail investors of more than $300 million globally.</p>
            <p>Forsage was introduced in January 2020 and has operated for over two years. The SEC claims that Forsage’s website promoted a “matrix cycler program” that offered substantial returns at little to no risk.</p>
            <p>Instead, however, the scheme worked like a pyramid scam, where investors made money by enticing other people to join the scheme.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/onecoin-review_orig.jpg" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>OneCoin</h2>
            <p>Ruja Ignatova, a citizen of Bulgaria, created the cryptocurrency-based Ponzi scheme OneCoin, which ran from 2014 to 2016. Unfortunately, the plan was just a scam, despite its claims to provide a new digital currency that could be mined.</p>
            <p>The company’s primary line of business was selling course materials, which were frequently plagiarized, as an MLM product where customers were compensated for bringing in new customers.</p>
            <p>OneCoin mining tokens were guaranteed to the purchasers of these course packages, but there was no OneCoin blockchain technology as promised. As a result, the tokens had no market value and could not be used to make purchases.</p>
            <p>Affiliates could not withdraw their funds because the OneCoin Exchange xcoinx, the company’s exchange for changing OneCoins into other currencies, was shut down in January 2017. OneCoin made the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/crowd1.png" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Crowd1</h2>
            <p>A business called Crowd1 describes itself as a high-tech community marketing operation and assures its members of substantial returns. An individual must purchase an “education package” straight from the business to begin earning money with Crowd1. However, a deeper look reveals several warning signs that suggest Crowd1 is a Ponzi scheme.</p>
            <p>One significant problem is that experts believe Crowd1’s packages, which range in price from €109 to €2499, are dummy goods created solely to earn affiliate commissions.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Crowd1’s compensation structure and packages are reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme, in which new members’ funds are used to pay out early members, and the cycle continues until all of the company’s pockets are full before it progressively folds. Crowd1 is among the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/royalq.jpg" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Royal Q</h2>
            <p>The multi-level marketing (MLM) fraud known as Royal Q claims to have been in business for four years and to have generated over $117 million in earnings in its first half.</p>
            <p>But a quick review of the company’s website and online footprint reveals that it was only incorporated in 2021 in Hong Kong and California, giving it less than four years of existence.</p>
            <p>It needs to be clarified how a bot produces such enormous profits, and the Royal Q website needs more information about the organization’s management.</p>
            <p>Many users of Royal Q have described their experiences as participating in a pyramid scheme, where members are enticed to bring in new members and benefit from their recruitment. Royal Q happens to make the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/force.jpg" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Meta Force</h2>
            <p>A new scam called Meta Force was started by Lado Okhotnikov, a notorious con artist who also created Forsage and it is one of the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
            <p>Okhotnikov has initiated six Forsage Ponzi schemes, the most recent of which was the Forsage BUSD, a crypto smart-contract Ponzi, which was unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>On January 11th, 2022, “meta-force. space,” the domain name for the Meta Force website, was first created. Last updated on June 25th, the secret registration.</p>
            <p>The website claims that Meta Force offers no resaleable goods or services and only permits associates to promote Meta Force affiliate membership. Affiliates who invest in the twelve-tier matrix cycler under the compensation scheme will receive 5 BUSD.</p>
            <p>Okhotnikov, who is thought to be a resident of Russia, is known for starting pyramid schemes under the name Forsage and has received warnings from the governments of numerous nations, including the United States, Georgia, and Russia, for running various Ponzi schemes.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/Amway_logo_1.png" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Amway</h2>
            <p>One of the first MLM businesses to emerge as Amway. The home, personal care, and wellness products manufacturer was established in Michigan in 1959. Despite years of accusations in numerous nations that the business operated a pyramid scheme, it has never been proven to be wrong.</p>
            <p>Amway was not deemed a pyramid scam by the FTC in 1979, but numerous lawsuits have been filed in the United States, Canada, and India to overturn that decision.</p>
            <p>Amway entered into a $56 million settlement in 2010 with a California class action lawsuit that accused the business of racketeering, fraud, and running an unauthorized pyramid scheme. Since then, the business has allegedly changed how it runs and we also recognize it as one of the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/Younique.jpg" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Younique</h2>
            <p>A relatively new MLM that offers cosmetics is called Younique. The firm was established in 2012, and between 2017 and 2019, the enormous cosmetics company Coty owned 60 percent of the business.</p>
            <p>Younique was charged with “having a cultish grip” on women who joined the MLM with the intention of becoming financially independent in a 2019 Guardian story. To keep their “presenter” position and receive commissions, Younique representatives must frequently purchase the company’s goods.</p>
            <p>Do your research and exercise caution if you’re considering starting an MLM business. Success can happen to some individuals, but there is some risk involved.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/Primerica.png" width="30%" alt="">
        <li>
            <h2>Primerica</h2>
            <p>An MLM firm called Primerica offers banking, investment, and insurance services to middle-class families in the United States and Canada.</p>
            <p>The firm, which has been operating for about 45 years, has frequently received criticism for the way it conducts business.</p>
            <p>In North America, Primerica has more than 130,000 independent agents. However, many detractors claim that those representatives need to be qualified to market the products because they are recruited into the program and need to gain a lot of insurance experience.</p>
            <p>To resolve 238 lawsuits alleging Primerica had taken advantage of Florida public workers by getting them to sell their government-secured retirement accounts and invest in high-risk Primerica retirement products, the company agreed to pay $9.3 million in 2014. It is also recognized as one of the top list of blacklisted MLM companies.</p>
        </li>

    <h1>Top MLM Companies</h1>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>doTERRA</h2>
            <p>There are numerous essential oil companies available in the market besides doTERRA. However, due to doTERRA’s requirement to use only 100% unadulterated essential oils, many people have switched over. As a result, on a scale of 1 to 10, doTERRA has regularly placed eighth in the industry.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Mary Kay</h2>
            <p>In Texas in 1963, Mary Kay Ash put it together. Regarding revenue among Networking Companies, Mary Kay has consistently performed well. The well-known name Mary Kay offers a variety of products for beauty, health, skincare, body care, nail care, and fragrance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Tupperware</h2>
            <p>Earl Tupper founded the renowned American plastic container manufacturer Tupperware in Massachusetts in 1948. From portable containers to domestic goods, it produces a variety of goods. Tupperware currently makes apparel and other goods as well.</p>
            <p>A typical Tupperware dealer can make an additional $700 to $800 per year thanks to increased home cooking and global food storage and safety concerns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Forever Living</h2>
            <p>Rex Maughan, the CEO of Forever Living International Products, started the MLM business in Arizona in 1978. With a stellar score of 9 out of 10, Forever Living regularly outperforms the rankings of the top MLM businesses in the United States.</p>
